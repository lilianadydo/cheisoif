I know that Made In Japan is considered THE classic live album (both as far as Deep Purple is concerned and also rock in general), but I've seen the 1972 Copenhagen footage online, and that show seemed amazing--and I feel that the Copenhagen version of "Space Truckin'" is better than the Made in Japan version (but I could be wrong). There are a lot of other Mark II live albums though. What's the best release sound quality and performance.
