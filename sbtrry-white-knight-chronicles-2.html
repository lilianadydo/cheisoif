                            <p>White Knight Chronicles II, the sequel to White Knight Chronicles: International Edition, is an epic role-playing game available exclusively on the PlayStation 3 computer entertainment system. The game masterfully blends the cinematic storytelling of a single player role-playing game (RPG) with an entertaining and interactive co-op multiplayer. White Knight Chronicles II is a video game developed by Level-5 and published by Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan and Europe as well as D3 Publisher in North America for the PlayStation 3. The game is a direct sequel to the 2008 title White Knight Chronicles and was announced 
GameSpot Sync - PSN issues, White Knight Chronicles II, Driver SF. Jody continues to bring news of the PSN issues, fills us in on some Marvel free-to-play action, and talks about White Knight. This was a game i've had interest in for years and i just came across it 2nd hand. i heard the servers are down and im just wondering if that effects the single player and as it's 2nd hand it wont have any store codes so i'm wondering if ill still be getting the remaster of the 1st game or not. Thank. White Knight Chronicles II continues the epic story of Leonard with a brand new 30+ hour single player campaign. Featuring a fully redesigned, dynamic new combat system, you can create. It's an old game, but I was finally getting around to play it. I have cleared Greede and was going to Balastor plains waterfall for the next part of the story. As I approach the large cavern that I guess will have a boss fight, the characters stop walking and I cannot move. I can rotate the camera and the music is playing, but I can't move around. I tried rebuilding the database, I deleted the game data and reinstalled it, and I left and came back but nothing works. Any suggestions. GameStop: Buy White Knight Chronicles II, D3 Publisher of America, PlayStation 3, Find release dates, customer reviews, previews and screenshots. I recently got White knight chronicles 2 that includes the 1st remastered game. I'm almost done and I got some questions since most of the info I found are wrong/outdated: 1. Can I re customize my avatar once I start 2? 2. If yes on 1, when/where? I got to 1st save in 2 but wasn't given the chance to do it. 3. Do I miss some content if I just start 2 without completing errands/hunts/quests. White Knight Chronicles II is a good quality sequel that fixed most of the errors of the first episode. It's not perfect, not a next-generation RPG, not a masterpiece, but is a pretty good game, if compared to the (low) current rating of similar products.

I've had the game for a few years but haven't even started to play it. I know the online mode was shut down a couple of years back. Is the game still worth playing offline? Thanks. I'd like to pick this up and play it with my little brother across the country. Will we be utterly alone or will there be anyone non Japanese on there. It is currently .xx on Amazon and seemed like a good deal. These games don't have the best review from critics but I wanted an honest opinion. Would it be worth it for the online. The online passes are used and Modnation is caseless, but I could throw it into a cd case if need be Edit: also interested in Vita offers. 
I plan on picking up a game tomorrow, but I cannot decide what I should get for the life of me. I was thinking about Bioshock or Dead Space because those are a couple of good series that I never got around to playing. I was also thinking about Kings of Amalur, but I'm unsure on that as well. I came across White Knight Chronicles 2 and thought that it looked decent. I've seen a couple of videos on it and it looks interesting to say the least. I was just wondering if any of you had an opinion. Hello all! I have: Defiance CiB Mortal Kombat - CiB Overlord Raising Hell - Map and CiB, but hard get Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2 - Case and game Borderlands GOTY -CiB with map Little Big Planet Vita - would prefer to do Vita for Vita Digimon World - PSX, hard get Digimon World 3- PSX, hard get Pending in: Bulletstorm Sealed PS3 Marvel vs Capcom 3 PS3 Dead Rising 2 PS3 Dead Island PS3 Dead Island Riptide PS3 Burnout ParadisePS3 Dante's Inferno PS3 (Maybe more, will double check. I'm looking for a JRPG to play after finishing Final Fantasy XIII ( ~_~ disappointing) I"ve looked for reviews but just found some review from some guy named. Looking to cut down on what I have a bit, willing to trade multiples! - Modern Warfare 2 - Saint's Row 2 - Warhawk - SOCOM: Confrontation - Rainbow Six Vegas 2 - Mercenaries 2 - Street Fighter 4 - El Shaddai (Brand New) - Brink - DBZ Raging Blast - Motorstorm Apoc - Tomb Raider Collection (Brand New) May be adding others.trying to decide what I may actually play. I may be getting a copy of MLB The Show 2012 as well due to a contest but that could be a while. I have a quick question about the White Knight Chronicles 2 trophy list. As it includes the first game, It doesn't have a separate game entry for the first in the trophy list. If I play through a standalone version of the first game are they the same list as for the second game? I'm in no rush to play the game so if they use different trophy lists then I'll wait until I pick up the first separately I guess. 
I looked foward for the first one, but knowing the sequel included the first one's story with remastered mechanics, I backed off. Now, I'm unsure if I will like the game. I enjoy games with a good story, with choices to customize my character and especially love a good crafting system (like Monster Hunter's). Any opinion from my fellow Redditors. Game Condition Console :-- :--: --: The Darkness 2 Still wrapped PS3 Ico amp Shadow of Colossus HD Collection Still wrapped PS3 ~~White Knight Chronicles 2 (with 1 included)~~ Still wrapped PS3 (sent to user zordon_rages) El Shaddai Ascension of the Metatron Still wrapped PS3 Dragons Age 2 Still wrapped PS3 Modnation Racers: Roadtrip Still wrapped VITA Mortal Kombat Still wrapped. NFS The Run has its code used, same with White Knight Chronicles 2 Edit: Also have Battlefield 3 for PS3 but no online code I believe if you've used the code for White Knight Chronicles 1, the code carries OK Gameswap, I'm in the middle of two trades and 1 more will make 10, so let's make it happen. BRING THE OFFERS. Willing to do multiples for the right offers as well! Here's what I got: - Modern Warfare 2 - Saint's Row 2 - Warhawk - SOCOM: Confrontation - Rainbow Six Vegas 2 - Mercenaries 2 - Street Fighter 4 Others That I May Want To Play First: - PS Move Heroes - Motorstorm Apoc - Dragon Ball Z Raging Blast - God of War Collection ALL PS3 offers will be considered! I think. I didn't play the first game, but I really just want to play the co-op mode with a friend. Is this worth the  or so it currently costs, or should we wait until it's lt.
